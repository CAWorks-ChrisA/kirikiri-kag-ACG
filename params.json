Where we work hard to deliver a visually immersive experience to the readers.\r\n### System\r\nThis game uses Kirikiri Z Engine. I would like to give credit to the creator of this engine. This engine is used to create lots of great visual novels, and it is maybe the only open-source visual novel dedicated engine out there. Thank you so much for giving programmers around the world to use such a great engine.\r\n\r\n### WE NEED HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\r\nHelp is greatly appreciated, please contact me if you are a kirikiri programmer.
